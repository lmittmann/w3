# Methods

`w3` supports most common RPC methods for Ethereum and other EVM chains. If you are in need of a method that is not supported by `w3` natively, you can use [third party method packages](#third-party-rpc-method-packages), or easily write a custom method-binding and use it with `w3`.

## RPC Namespaces

RPC methods supported by `w3` are grouped into namespaces.
